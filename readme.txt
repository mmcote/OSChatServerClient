Client-side protocol instructions:

When the client connects to the server you will be asked if you would like to (1) query the server or (2) update an entry in the whiteboard. 
The user is then prompted to type in the whiteboard entry number they wish to access. 
If the the action is a whiteboard entry/update, the application will ask for what message you would like to send as well as whether you would like to send it as encrypted. If it is encrypted, the application will show you the encrypted message before sending.  
The server then sends the result of the query to the client if the action was a query result.
